# Queue

You can think of queues like a line to wait for your seat at the table at a restaurant. The person who got there earlier has dibs on getting a seat before you. Queues follow the FIFO principle — "First In, First Out". The element that has been added to the queue first will also be the first to be removed. Pretty straightforward right?
