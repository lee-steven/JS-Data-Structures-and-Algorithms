<!-- I personally like to think of stacks like _pancakes_ — I mean who doesn't like a stack of pancakes (tbh I do prefer waffles but...). Anways, just like a plate full of stacked pancakes, in a stack, you only have access to the top most element. Only after you remove the top most element can you access the next element in the stack (which is now the top most stack). The stack data structure follows a principle called LIFO which means "Last In, First Out" — meaning that the most recent element that you added (push) to the stack will be the first element to be removed (pop).<br /> <br />
If the pancake analogy didn't make much sense to you, here's some other analogies, a stack of... clothes, plates, books, towels, and the list goes on. "What can you use stacks for?" You may be asking. Well honestly I haven't personally used a stack outside of my courses and well this, but some ways to use a stack and some ways stacks have been used are to reverse a word, backtracking, parenthesis validation, among other things.  -->
