# Data Structures and Algorithms in Javascript

Hey there! This is a repository for Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in JavaScript.
I've been wanting to practice for the technical interview and get better at JavaScript so thought I might as well share this with everyone!
<br />
These are by no means the best implementations, but I hope this repo can help anyone who is in the same boat.
<br />
If you have any questions/suggestions/anything feel free to reach out!
